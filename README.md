#Welcome
* Welcome to our github project page!
* Take a moment to create a gitjub account if you don't have one, and let me know your username or the email you used to create it.  I will add you as a collaborator.
* Learning how to use Git will be a little bit of a learning curve, but it should have big benefits in the long run, and will be awesome on your resume as GIT is used professionally as a standard in Software development

##Usage
* best conduct is to create a new branch from the "master" branch and make your changes there.
* then in your git hub client, commit your changes, and create a pull request to pull your branch back into the master branch (aka the trunk).
* This guy looks like he has some good [this guy](https://youtu.be/1h9_cB9mPT8) for learning how GIT works.
* you will probably find it helpful to [download](https://desktop.github.com) the GitHub desktop app.

>I'm super happy to help you guys learn git. I am by no means a pro, but would love to help, just ask.

Thanks!

**You guys are studs.**
